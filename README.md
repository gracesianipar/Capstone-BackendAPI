# API Deployment with Cloud Run

This project demonstrates how to create an API for predictions using a machine learning model and deploy it on Google Cloud Run. It utilizes Docker to containerize the application for seamless deployment and scalability.

## Key Features

- API for Predictions: Exposes an endpoint that takes input data and returns predictions using a trained machine learning model.
- Docker: The API is containerized using Docker to ensure consistency and portability across environments.
- Cloud Run Deployment: The containerized application is deployed on Google Cloud Run for scalability and ease of access.
- GitHub Integration: This repository is integrated with GitHub for automating the testing and code delivery processes, to simplify the deployment process.
